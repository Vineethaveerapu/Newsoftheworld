How to solve the state problems
States Needed

----------------------------------------

To show the articles of just one category:

State = selectedCategory - default value is null

New component that takes the selectedCategory as  prop:

    component DisplayCategory = ( {categoryToDisplay}) = { ... }

On Page Load;

   if selected Category is null show home Page

   if not null load <DisplayCategory categoryToDisplay={selectedCategory}

To set the selectedCategory we need to allow the Navigation Items to set the selectedCategory state

So we need to pass the setSelectedCategory function to the nav Items


------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To show all the details of one Article:

State selectedArticle = default value null

New component that takes the selectedArticle as  prop:

DisplayArticle Component = ({articleToDisplay}) =>

On Page Load;

   if selectedArticle is null show home Page

   if not null load <DisplayArticle articleToDisplay={selectedArticle}

To set selectedArticle we need to allow the headlines of every article we already have to update the state

This means we will need to pass the setSelectedArticle function down through several components - both children and grandchildren.
